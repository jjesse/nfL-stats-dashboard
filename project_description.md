Good evening,

I would like to work on a web page that is a dashboard of NFL stats. It will live on Github at some point, in a Github page and be updated automatically by Github actions. I hope that helps with some design choices.

Here is what I'm looking for and we will get more complicated as we go:

1. A clean, modern design that is easy to navigate.
2. A header with the title "NFL Stats Dashboard" and a navigation menu with links to
    - Home
    - Schedule
    - Team Stats
    - Player Stats
        - Quarterbacks Leaders
        - Receivers Leaders
        - Rushing Leaders
    - About 
3. A footer with copyright information.
4. The home page should have a welcome message and a brief description of the dashboard's purpose.
5. The Schedule page should display the upcoming games in a table format with columns for Date, Time, Home Team, Away Team, Record for each, and Venue.
6. The Team Stats page should have a summary of team statistics in a table format with columns for Team Name, Wins, Losses, Points Scored, Points Allowed, and Win Percentage.
7. The Player Stats page should have sub-pages for Quarterbacks Leaders, Receivers Leaders, and Rushing Leaders, each displaying a table with relevant statistics for the top players in those categories.
8. The About page should provide information about the dashboard, its data sources, and the author.

We will start with this and then add more features later.

I would like the following documentation:
1. A README.md file that explains the purpose of the project, how to set it up, and how to contribute.
2. Comments in the code to explain the structure and functionality of the web page.
3. A TODO list for what we are working on next.

Good luck and thanks for the help
